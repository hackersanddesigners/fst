<p><font><b> Language of publication</b></font><font> refers to the predominant language of a publication*. It is an interesting filter to consider in the light of our question: </font><font  ><i>Why are the authors of the books I read so white, so male, so Eurocentric?</i></font><font>, because it shows how difficult it is to make conclusions about race and nationality of the author on the basis of the language of an item. Despite those shortcomings, this filter clearly reflects that English remains the dominant language of global scholarly publishing, with 81,52% of the items of this data set being published in English.  This highlights a linguistic monoculture, that scholars such as Gloria E. Anzaldúa have long tried to criticize and attempted to intervene in. Additionally, the fact that English, Dutch, French, Italian and German are the five most frequent languages of publication is – despite of the occurrence of some of these languages in different geographical contexts – still very telling for how our Western knowledge economy functions.</font></p>
