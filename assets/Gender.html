<p><font>For the data set of the Feminist Search Tool, Hackers &amp; Designers have linked our data set to Wikidata and 2 other data bases. Possible flaws that come with this linking of these data sets, is that wikidata attributes gender on the basis of the name. Self-narration, particularly important when it comes to trans* and non-binary identities, unfortunately aren’t included in this data set, which might lead to misrepresentations.  The information regarding </font><font><b>gender assigned to an author</b></font><font> is information, which the Utrecht University (UU) library cannot provide access to. Information about “gender assigned/attributed to an author” is stored in a separate data base – for which the UU library does not possess direct access. The separate datatbase hosts the so-called  ‘authority files’ which include more detailed information regarding the gender and nationality of an author.</font></p>
