<p><font><b> Language of publication</b></font><font> refers to the predominant language of a publication*. It is an interesting filter to consider in the light of our question: </font><font><i>Why are the authors of the books I read so white, so male, so Eurocentric?</i></font><font>, because it shows how difficult it is to make conclusions about race and nationality of the author on the basis of the language of an item. Despite those shortcomings, this filter clearly reflects that English remains the dominant language of global scholarly publishing, with 81,52% of the items of this data set being published in English.  This highlights a linguistic monoculture, that scholars such as Gloria E. Anzaldúa have long tried to criticize and attempted to intervene in. Additionally, the fact that English, Dutch, French, Italian and German are the five most frequent languages of publication is – despite of the occurrence of some of these languages in different geographical contexts – still very telling for how our Western knowledge economy functions.</font></p>

<p>The filter </font><font><b>Multiple languages</b></font><font> refers to those publications that are multilingual and/or for which no predominant language of publication can be identified*. This is an interesting filter, as it challenges the linguistic monoculture of English as the language of global scholarly publishing.</font></p>

<p>*This filter is an interpretation of the MARC 21 tag 008 - All Materials (NR), character positions 35-37, subfield code ‘mul’ and tag </font><font><b>041 - Language Code (R) </b></font><font>including those items marked as ‘mul’.</font></p>

<p><u>Translated Work</u></font></p>
<p>This filter refers to those publications that either </font><font><b>are or include a translation</b></font><font>.  Hereby, it is interesting to check not only the number of works that are published as translated works, but also what the original language, and the target language of the item is (see filter Original language).</font></p>

<p><u>Original language</u></font></p>
<p>This filter refers to the </font><font><b>original language of a publication</b></font><font>*.  This field only needs to be filled in if the publication is/or includes a translation. This would suggest that through this filter one could make conclusions about the original language of a translated work. However, given that this field also refers to those items simply including translations and/or could be filled in accidently, it is important to bear in mind that the results of this filter could also be misleading.</font></p>
