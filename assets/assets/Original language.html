<p>This filter refers to the </font><font><b>original language of a publication</b></font><font>*.  This field only needs to be filled in if the publication is/or includes a translation. This would suggest that through this filter one could make conclusions about the original language of a translated work. However, given that this field also refers to those items simply including translations and/or could be filled in accidently, it is important to bear in mind that the results of this filter could also be misleading.</font></p>
