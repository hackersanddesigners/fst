<p><font>This filter indicates a certain time period associated with the name of an author.* It is usually filled in if two names resemble each other to distinguish between them. The time periods registered here could either indicate the lifespan of an author, and as such whether the author is dead or alive, but could also indicate a period of flourishing. This is a potential limitation of our interpretation of this field.</font></p>
