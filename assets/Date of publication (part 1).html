<p>For the data set of the Feminist Search Tool, Read-in made a selection of the records of the Utrecht University library on the basis of the dates of publication. Therefore, the time period of the publications of this data set are works published between 2006 and 2016. Read-in selected this specific time-frame in order to attain a data set that would be manageable to work with in the limited time we were given.  Choosing a more recent time-frame was motivated by the following observation(s) the art collective Guerilla Girls had made in the following fragments, anticipating an often heard utterance that the questions weâ€™d be addressing would maybe had been a problem in the past, but surely no more today:</font></p>
